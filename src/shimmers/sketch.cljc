(defn wrap-fns
  "[[wrap-fns]] allows dynamic redefinition of a function such as `draw` and
  `update` in cljs. This is achieved by wrapping all provided functions to
  anonymous functions such that `my-draw` function turns into
  `(fn [& args] (apply my-draw args))`. This adds a level of indirection
  so that when quil calls `draw`, it invokes anonymous function which in
  turn always calls `my-draw` by name and if you redefine, the new version
  will be used. Hence we need this cryptic macro."

;; Problem:
;;
;; q/defsketch both defines and mounts the sketch. To delay sketch invocation
;; until selection from index or routing route, each namespace wraps the call to
;; defsketch in an outer `run-sketch` method. The index is then built from the
;; list of run-sketches specified and when a link is followed or the app is
;; restarted, the the run-sketch is re-triggered. However that makes it
;; difficult to specify per sketch information like creation time, tags, or to
;; associate other actions at time of mount. As "run-sketch" is the magic
;; starting point that also limits each namespace to one sketch.
;;
;; defquil is a first step towards controlling the mechanism of defining
;; sketches. Currently it mostly mimics the existing mechanism of defining a
;; single `run-sketch`, while adding a hook for running a function at mount.
;;
;; Plan:
;;
;; - [x] Wrap quil.sketch/sketch call with appropriate reagent definitions so that they respect react lifecycle hooks? -- See reagent-quil-component sketch
;; - [x] Allow more than one sketch per namespace
;; - [x] 2+ sketches in parallel (probably less useful except for long form explanation)
;; - [x] Multiple sketches from the same namespace, each with own index entry
;; - [ ] Is it possible to wrap defsketch and reduces the overlap?
;; - [ ] Assist in passing parameters like RNG seed into the sketch at invoke?
;; - [x] add sketches to a registry automatically ala

;;
;; Modified from defsketch in
;; https://github.com/quil/quil/blob/master/src/cljs/quil/sketch.clj#L22
;; to allow modifications like auto-starting explanation and metadata like date.

;; defquil is deprecated, use definition but still need to incorporate add-sketch-to-init-list to component
