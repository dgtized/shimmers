;; The intended concept is to plot out bezier curves from a source circle or
;; stem, and then add circles that are tangent to the curve, and then randomly
;; extend new bezier curves out from the circles generated before. Presumably
;; those curves should not intersect, and neither should the circles so there is
;; some circle packing as well. It's likely there is going to be a lot of S
;; curves with tangents on one side mirrored on the "outside". Also, each circle
;; may need to have a "direction" of rotation that curves emit from so they pair
;; up.

;; Right now it's just playing with straight lines from tangent points, but the
;; circles are arranged somewhat analagous to perspective lines to focal points,
;; so alternatively could make a different sketch around rotating perspectives.
