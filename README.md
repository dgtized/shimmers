# shimmers

Shimmering quil sketches; a few particle simulations, video processing
experiments, randomly generated L-systems, 3d transformations, and cellular
automata.

Note: Some sketches require camera input, so it will prompt for video
permissions, but it's not transmitting the video anywhere, just processing it
locally.
